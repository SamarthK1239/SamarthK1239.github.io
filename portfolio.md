### Programming
 As you'll probably know by now, I'm an avid programmer.
 
 Over the course of my 7 years of programming, i've worked on a host of different projects. Most of these have involved hardware elements and an arduino, but I have developed software only products as well. I also do some freelance web design in my free time and especially during summers.
 
### Freelancing
 I run my own website and blog at www.scholarfun.com. The main theme is education, and I handpick news articles and write my own blogs. It also has a used bookstore with a payment gateway to fundraise for my social cause. In all, I have over 2800 unique users on my website. I have run the website for over 5 years and have run fundraisers for over 4 years.
 
 I have also developed two websites on a freelance basis:
 
 The first one was for an artist who was looking to sell her art online. This included a blog, gallery, payment gateway and automatic chatbot. I was given a monetary compensation for the time and effort for this project. You can find it at www.novartium.com
 
 The second one was a personal blog for a doctor who was looking to share her works of literature. This includes a gallery, blog section and special pages to showcase the works. I was also given monetary compensation for this project. You can find it at www.tobedecided.com
 
### Internship
 Over the course of the summer of 2020, I worked under Dr. Bruce Campbell of Brown University to research and develop a Brain Computer Interface (BCI). This is a system that reads the brain waves of an individual and can interpret what they mean. I am currently writing and intend to publish a paper on this subject with our findings and procedures.
 
 Over the two months, we formulated a method to take Brain waves, process them, and then use a Machine Learning algorithm called an LSTM to interpret them and predict what they may mean. We constantly collaborated, shared ideas, code and more with each other.
 
### Social Cause
 The main social cause I carry out is, in conjunction to the theme of my website, www.scholarfun.com, education. I run fundraisers on my website, through both the bookstore and events I host. All funds collected go towards the Akshaya Patra Foundation, which supports underpriveleged children in school by providing them with midday meals.
 
 Last year I held webinars with the theme of careers. These were to help my peers and juniors with selecting a path of study and to expose them to streams they may have not considered. Viewers were encouraged to donate to the charity fund if they found the session helpful. I was also running a facebook campaign to collect funds.
 
 Every year, I set a goal for myself. The first year I started fundraising, I started small, with only Rs. 5,000. Then the next year that sum jumped to Rs. 11,000. The year after, I collected Rs. 22,000. And finally, last year, I set and reached the ambitious target of Rs. 1,10,000.
 
 Taken together, all the donations I have made over the last 4 years have fed 130+ children with 48,000+ meals!
 
 ### Other Interests
 Apart from my focused interesting in programming, I really enjoy cooking, and am a foodie at heart. I usually watch cooking shows when I'm on a break or getting bored, and if something really interests me, I give making it a shot.
 
 I'm not really into most conventional sports, but I did take horseback riding lessons for a few years and absolutely loved it. I was quite good at it too, and my instructors wanted me to start competeing. Unfortunately two falls, the first resulting in stitches and the second in a broken collarbone, freaked my parents out enough to not let me continue. If given the chance, I would absolutely try again!
