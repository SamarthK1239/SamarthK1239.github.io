## Projects

Here's a list of major projects that you can find on my GitHub, I am currently in the process of writing documentation for a lot of these projects, so you may not be able to access them right now.

- [IGCSE Pre-Release Solutions]() | [Github](https://github.com/SamarthK1239/IGCSE-PreReleaseMaterialSolutions)

These projects are completed to varying degrees (and may *not* be completed). The code that is here is mostly well documented through commenting, but will eventually get their own explanatory pages.
