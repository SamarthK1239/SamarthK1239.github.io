## Welcome!

Hello there! My name is Samarth Kulkarni and I'm currently a sophomore at Penn State, where I'm studying computer science. I've been passionate about programming for almost a decade now, and I love participating in hackathons and other competitive programming events. When I'm not busy coding, you can usually find me playing badminton or billiards, or watching a movie with friends!
